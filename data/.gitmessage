# fix: deadlock in i2c transmit
#
# [Problem]:
# 1. Deadlock in waiting i2c stop busy.
# 2. i2c still in busy when transmit continue without stop over 25ms.
#
# [Root cause]:
# 1. Doesn't enable i2c timeout features.
#
# [Solution]:
# 1. Enable i2c timeout features on each in use i2c controller.
# 2. Set timeout feature enable bit 'TOEN' from i2c 'TMOUT' register.
# 3. Included polling timeout flag 'TO' bit in i2c 'STS' register when processing data transfer.
# 4. Return timeout error '-ETO' when data processing over 25ms when 'TO' bit is set from i2c 'STS' register.
